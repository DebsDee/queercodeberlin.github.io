### Queer Code

![Logo]({{ site.url }}/img/logo.png)

The group' s main goals is to connect and support queer people (of all flavors) working in jobs related to software development. This group is not meant for allies.

We protect our members privacy at all costs. Feel free to join us with a separate anonymous account. We will come up with a plan to make it possible that people can meet without fear of being identified by others.
Different types of events are planned right now:
 - individual support, guidance, mentoring
 - meetings to find peers in other companies
 - workshops to advance professionally
