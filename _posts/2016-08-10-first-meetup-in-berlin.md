## First Queer Code Meeting in Berlin

Ten queer people came together to talk about programming languages, mentoring, pronouns, coming out, marginalized groups and more.

It was fun, it was cool and everybody was keen to meet again.

A huge thanks to [Sonntags Club](http://www.sonntags-club.de/) for hosting so nicely.
